# flight_ticklet_price_prediction
Predicting Flight Ticket Price is not easy but I Create a model which predict Flight Ticket Price.
I train the model using a dataset that i have downloaded from this https://www.machinehack.com/course/predict-the-flight-ticket-price-hackathon/.Its a hackathon competition dataset.Trained the model based on this dataset.Ita regression problem statement.
Project Pipeline:- Data Collection done through  https://www.machinehack.com/course/predict-the-flight-ticket-price-hackathon/ this website.
Data Preprocessing,Feature Engineering,Feature Selection done through using Numpy,Pandas,matplotlib,seaborn.
Lasso regression used for the purpose of feature selection.Train the model using RandomForest and used RandomizedSearCV for Hyperparameter optimization for better performance
